This repository contains code for a virtual version of the game "Lost
Cities".  My family owns the game and after a Christmas spent playing
the game over-and-over, I wanted to come up with a systematic way of
testing out various strategies.  This eventually morphed into a desire
to analyze the game probabilistically.  But that moves away from the
purpose of this README.

The main structures needed for playing the game are found in
lost_cities.py.  In that file, there is a card class and a board
class.  The game_board class contains everything needed for playing
the game.  There are also several functions (play_game and
computer_turn) which automate a computer vs computer game as well as
single turns for the AI.  

The strategy.py game contains strategies for AI's the game.  There is
currently only one strategy available for playing/drawing, though a
second strategy is being developed in one of the branches.  The
comments in this file are more extensive and are intended to allow for
additional strategies to be added.

The files comp_v_comp.py and play_computer.py are the two scripts for
actually playing the game.  The first, comp_v_comp.py, allows the user
to select play/draw strategies for two AI's and then simulate n games
against each other.  The play_computer.py allows the user to play an
AI.
